Do this stuff after everything is fixed:
	UNIT TESTS
	USER FEEDBACK

General Issues:
	[HIGH] Audio playback uses wrong samples
	[SUPREMELY BAD] No dispatcher/marshal distinction, everything is running on UI thread
	--[LOW] Theme initializes incorrectly--
	[HIGH] Use the logger more often, it's very good
	[HIGH] General variable sloppiness. Variables prefixed with underscores should be private
	[HIGH] Lots of service singleton initialization in Library/LibraryView/LibraryContextMenus Can we avoid this? It adds a lot of boilerplate
	[HIGH] Optimize everything
	--[HIGH] SKXamlCanvas isn't very performant when being invalidated & resized. Identify bottleneck or enable hwaccel--
	[HIGH] OpenAL for cross platform audio playback only handles PCM data. It is intended for us to use ffmpeg to decode mp3/other to PCM for playback. Current implementation uses temp files for debugging, waveform displays correctly but playback does not work
    [HIGH] Document/Canvas tabs should be unique and separated from all other tabs. Right now this causes a crash when user tries to drag a panel into the document tab

Taskbar:
	--//[LOW] No New Document command//--
	[LOW] Import to Library command only contains bitmap files-- What are all of our importable files?
	[LOW] No revert functionality
	[MED] Export Image no functionality
	[MED] Export Video In-Mem rendering locks up on my system
	[MED] Export Video specified frame range should enable new controls for specifying a frame range to render
	[MED] Render Canvas Background does nothing, current renderer doesn't add the canvas BG

Library Panel:
	[HIGH] Sounds should be able to be stopped
	[MED] SKXamlCanvas appears behind bitmap preview, all previews should be exclusive to each other
	[MED] UserLibrarySelection should persist through documents
	[HIGH] LibraryViewModel loads _workingCsXFLDoc between 2 and 4 times. Inconsistency from the docking system's onActiveDockableChanged event. How do we debounce this?
	[HIGH] Bitmap .dat decoding crashes the program. Unclear on the intended priority for loading bitmaps/audio for preview
	[HIGH] Click-drag rearranging uses pointer events. Consult my good friend Mr. AI. Should it use Drag&Drop events?
	[HIGH] Click-drag rearranging should expand the hovered-over folder for the user's benefit
	[HIGH] File explorer D&D for flatview is correctly implemented, HierchicalTree D&D should have the above behavior
	--[MED] Waveform preview doesn't scale correctly, gradually gets worse as symbols are previewed--
	[HIGH] Double tapping name to edit doesn't work
	[HIGH] No way to duplicate items in the library
	[HIGH] No clipboard service
	[HIGH] No memento service
	[HIGH] LibraryContextMenu functions should all do something
	[MED] No Sound Properties panel, no Bitmap Properties panel
	--[LOW] When searching, [x] Items should become [x] Results where x is the length of FlatItems passing the search--
	[LOW] Name/Type/UseCount spacing should be synchronized between both TreeViews and name length shouldn't update the spacing
