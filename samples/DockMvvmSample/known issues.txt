Do this stuff after everything is fixed:
	OPTIMIZATION PASS
	UNIT TESTS
	USER FEEDBACK

Do it later:
	[MEH] Hotkeys storage & defaults
    [HIGH] Document/Canvas tabs should be unique and separated from all other tabs. Right now this causes a crash when user tries to drag a panel into the document tab
	Store a workspace .xml to save & restore workspaces
		This will require Windows toolbar to summon/dismiss panels	

General Issues:
	Want my TL BR rounded rect for modals -- DialogOverlayPopupHost >> Border PART_ContentBackground
	Pointer position zoom in Bitmap Preferences is funky

Taskbar:
	[LOW] No New Document command
	[LOW] No revert functionality
	[LOW] Import to Library command only contains bitmap files-- What are all of our importable files?
	[MED] Export Image no functionality
	[MED] Export Video specified frame range should enable new controls for specifying a frame range to render
	Export Video ffmpeg progress dialog

Library Panel:
	Need Connor Help:

	Some things don't render-- look at Sunset file
	Render Canvas Background does nothing, current renderer doesn't add the canvas BG
	Export Video In-Mem rendering locks up on my system
	Bitmap .dat decoding crashes the program

	Do this yourself:

	**Hierchical Source & Flat Source PER DocumentViewModel
		* Otherwise, folder expansion states persist between open documents

	** first click drag fails-- not part of userlibraryselection

	File explorer D&D for flatview is correctly implemented, HierchicalTree D&D should hover & folder autoexpand before dropping
	Double tapping name to edit doesn't work

	[HIGH] No clipboard service-- mainwindowviewmodel, CsXFL importtofile
		In Animate; Copied symbol and all dependencies are added to a buffer, don't need the source document open to importtofile

	[HIGH] No memento service
		-- requires hotkeys

	[LOW] Make Bitmap/Sound/Symbol properties look nice & add functionality
		How to handle replacing data?

	[LOW] Name/Type/UseCount spacing should be synchronized between both TreeViews and name length shouldn't update the spacing
	
	// // //
	Preferences load are fucked

Canvas:

	DocumentViewModel enqueue warning + animation
	Fade in/out animation for loading

	Registration point logic err help me connor
