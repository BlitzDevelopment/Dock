Do this stuff after everything is fixed:
	OPTIMIZATION PASS
	UNIT TESTS
	USER FEEDBACK

General Issues:
	[MED] Alt code handling
	[MEH] Preferences

	[MEH] Hotkeys & storage & defaults
	[HIGH] MP3 playback?
	[SUPREMELY BAD] No dispatcher/marshal distinction, everything is running on UI thread
	**[HIGH] Lots of service singleton initialization in Library/LibraryView/LibraryContextMenus Can we avoid this? It adds a lot of boilerplate
	[HIGH] General variable sloppiness. Variables prefixed with underscores should be private
    [HIGH] Document/Canvas tabs should be unique and separated from all other tabs. Right now this causes a crash when user tries to drag a panel into the document tab

Taskbar:
	--//[LOW] No New Document command//--
	[LOW] Import to Library command only contains bitmap files-- What are all of our importable files?
	[LOW] No revert functionality
	[MED] Export Image no functionality
	[MED] Export Video In-Mem rendering locks up on my system
	[MED] Export Video specified frame range should enable new controls for specifying a frame range to render
	[MED] Render Canvas Background does nothing, current renderer doesn't add the canvas BG

Library Panel:
	[low] variable to disable hit testing for non-editable items (other than folders)

	[HIGH] Play should turn into Stop while sound is playing
	[MED] first click drag fails-- not part of userlibraryselection
	[HIGH] Bitmap .dat decoding crashes the program

	[HIGH] File explorer D&D for flatview is correctly implemented, HierchicalTree D&D should have the above behavior
	[HIGH] Double tapping name to edit doesn't work

	[HIGH] No way to duplicate items in the library
	[HIGH] No clipboard service
	[HIGH] No memento service
	[HIGH] LibraryViewModel loads _workingCsXFLDoc between 2 and 4 times. Inconsistency from the docking system's onActiveDockableCha

	!! Make Bitmap/Sound/Symbol properties look nice & add functionality !!

	[LOW] Name/Type/UseCount spacing should be synchronized between both TreeViews and name length shouldn't update the spacing
